"""Which therapy approach fits the client – a transparent, rule-based suggestion next to therapist matching.

The approaches and their profiles live in data/valituki/modalities.json (a demo table a clinical owner would approve).
Two components, each 0–1, weighted to 0–100 like therapist matching:

- goals: how well the approach suits the client's approved goal topics (the referral's topics until the client has
  approved goals of their own);
- workingStyle: the client's approved working-style wishes against the approach's typical way of working, on the same
  1–5 levels as the therapists' in matching.

Practice during the wait is not counted: only cognitive behavioural therapy has guided exercises in the app, so it would
always gain from them. Only data the client allows to be used in matching is used, as in therapist matching. No language
model takes part and the same input always gives the same order. It is a suggestion for the professional's decision, not
a treatment recommendation.
